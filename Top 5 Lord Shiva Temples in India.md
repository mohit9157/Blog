Shiva, the preeminent force as per the Hindu religious beliefs, had a significant influence in the formation of Indian culture. The Lord Shiva is considered among the three primary energies behind the formation of this universe.

He is also known as **Mahadeva** in the northern piece of the nation and **Thillai** in South.

# Popular Lord Shiva Temple in India

## Somnath Mahadev

One of the most famous temple among all. This divine temple is located in Veraval in Saurashtra on the western coast of Gujarat, India. It is believed to be the first among the twelve (12), **"Jyotiling"**, **Shrines of Shiva**.

With its spectacular views of both divinity and sea aside makes it more beautiful. Reconstructed several times in the past after repeated destruction by several invaders and rulers.

The site of Somnath has been a pilgrimage site from ancient times on account of being a **Triveni Sangam** (the confluence of three rivers: **Kapila**, **Hiran** and the mythical **Sarasvati**).

**Soma**, the Moon god, is believed to have lost his lustre due to a curse, and he bathed in the Sarasvati River at this site to regain it. The result is said to be the waxing and waning of the moon.

The name of the town **Prabhas**, meaning lustre, as well as the alternative names **Someshvar** and **Somnath** ("the lord of the moon" or "the moon god") arise from this tradition.

### How to reach

- **By road**: Reach direct to Somnath from any city of Gujarat, India, many private buses are operating on daily basis and also government buses too.
- **By train**: There are less direct train from travellers destination thus the convenience way is to reach Rajkot, Junagadh or Veraval from which traveller can get another train to Somnath. Just go with the time table 😊
- **By flight**: Reach to Rajkot from your destination and then travellers can have option for buses and railways just follow or inquiry about the timings of both.

**My Tip**: Once in a lifetime must visit to this beautiful temple, where you can get spectacular views, history, cold breeze of seaside, amazing atmosphere (mostly in winters and in evenings of summer), In short you will have a great time with your dear ones. Har Har Mahadev.

## Amarnath Mahadev

This beautiful temple is located in J&K(Jammu & Kashmir), at around 3,888 MT (i.e. 12,756 FT). The temple is covered by cave and that cave is covered by snowy mountains. The cave itself is covered with snow most of the year, except for a short period of time in summer when it is open to pilgrims.

Many Hindus and other devotees make an annual pilgrimage to the Amarnath cave across challenging mountainous terrain. The Amarnath Cave Temple is one of the 51 **Shakti Peethas**, temples throughout South Asia that commemorate the location of fallen body parts of the hindu deity **Sati**.

Inside the 40 m (130 ft.) high cave, a _stalagmite_ is formed due to the freezing of water drops that fall from the roof of the cave onto the floor and grow upward vertically from the cave floor.

It is considering to be Shiva Linga by Hindus. According to Hindu religious beliefs, this is the place where Shiva explained the secret of life and eternity to his divine consort, **Goddess Parvati**.

Another religious belief is said that the lingam grows and shrinks with the phases of the moon in Summer festivals when the cave is open for pilgrimages, rest of the months the whole cave is covered with snow.

Visitors can explore spectacular views of the beautiful valleys with an amazing atmosphere, there are tents at various points in pursuing yatra where one can rest, **Pandal** tents serving free community kitchen food to the pilgrims the only rule is to not waste any food and don't make the place dirty with leftover foods and plastics. In short keep the holy place clean. **July - August** is the best time to visit.

<img class="image image--xl" src="/assets/images/posts/spiritual/lord-shiva-temples/7.jpg" alt="Valley"/>

### How to reach

- **By road**: Reach to Jammu, India from your place, then take a bus to Pahalgam which is the starting point of the yatra.
- **By train**: Reach to Jammu, India from your place, then take a bus to Pahalgam which is the starting point of the yatra. Because there is no railway connectivity yet.
- **By flight**: Reach to Jammu or Srinagar ("I think the alight airport is Srinagar") India from your place, then take a bus to Pahalgam which is the starting point of the yatra. Because there is no flight connectivity yet.

### Note

- Many private taxis and buses or any other private vehicles are also operating from Jammu to Pahalgam.
- After reaching to Pahalgam, there are 2 ways to reach **Holy Amarnath Cave**,
  1. Baltal
  2. Panchtarni.
- Baltal is **short but risky way** to cave and Panchtarni is **long way but easiest way**. Yatri can choose way according to convenience. Yatris can also opt for helicopter rides which starts from Pahalgam to Panchtarni (i.e. 6kms away from the Cave).

**My Tip**: Never think about the difficulties while en-routing because I think Mahadev will give you enough power and energy if you have that positivity in your heart not in mind.

Once in a lifetime must visit to experience the valley views, those good foods in the pandal tents, that shivering cold while sleeping on floor covered with cold mattresses with wet blanket, that starry night views covered with snow cap mountains, that serene feeling while sitting alone at night enjoying the starry sky, freezing cold water shower before entering the cave a lots more magic happen there must must must visit.

#### Memorandum

I am Saluting to those brave hearted people and animals, without that this Yatra won't be possible.

1. Indian army
2. The Pithhus ("The people who come with you to the end with either ponies or palanquin ("Palkies")".
3. Those people(Hindus + Muslims and other religion too) who takes Yatris to Baba's Cave for Divinity.

#### Chant **Har Har Mahadev**.

## Kedarnath Mahadev

This holy temple Kedarnath is famous for being an abode to one among the 12 Jyotirlingas and also a very famous Shiva temple in India. It is located in Uttrakhand state. This enchanting temple is nestled amidst the Garhwal Himalayan Range and is visited by pilgrims while they commence their Char Dham Yatra of Uttarakhand, visiting Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri along with this holy shrine of Lord Shiva. Since it is located about 3,583 m (11,755 Ft.) above sea level near Chorabari Glacier, the source of the Mandakini river, and is flanked by snow-capped peaks, most prominently the Kedarnath Mountain., the temple cannot be accessed via proper roads and the pilgrims have to trek uphill for 22kms from Gaurikund.

<img class="image image--xl" src="/assets/images/posts/spiritual/lord-shiva-temples/8.jpg" alt="Kedarnath Temple"/>

The name **"Kedarnath"** means **"the lord of the field"**. It is believed that after **Kurukshetra** war, Pandavas visited Kedarnath temple.

The Kedarnath valley, was hit with unprecedented flash floods on 16 and 17 June 2013. A huge rock got stuck behind Kedarnath Temple and protected it from the ravages of the flood. The waters gushed on both the sides of the temple destroying everything in their path. The rock which protected the temple is worshipped as the God's Rock (भीम शीला). This was the saddest event in the mankind history, many devotees were still missing, many families were destroyed. Shiv bless them wherever they are. I salute and appreciate to Indian Army, Indian Air Force and many private services for avid help and service.
**Jay Hind.**

I think the journey of kedarnath uphill is not so easy if your energy fails in your heart, I think the uphill breathtakingly views, those garma garm Maggie and chai, pithu & ponies rides and the vibe makes your adrenaline move faster and fresher, the weather is unpredictable here but that makes the journey more exciting. I think that the journey makes more beautiful and memorable with friends.

**My Tip**: Thodi si brandy le kar chalni hogi kyuki raat mein upper thand badh jati hai, as this was my personal experience I visited to shiva when I was around 15 or so, at that time as a kiddo I had never seen snow in my life so I went crazy and I played in snow for hours and boss subah ki 5 baje ki aarti ke time par bhai ko thandi chhadh gay, tabhie papa ne thodi si brady pani mein mix kar ke pila di thi and I slept for about 5-6 hours missed aarti but that was the magical experience for I think ab to generation experienced and advance ho chuki hai to must visit once. Haan one more thing after completing the trek when you come to downhill must have a bath in the warm water in Gauri Kund, aapki thakan dur kar degi yeh.

## Kashi Vishwanath Mahadev

There is one famous saying in Surat, Gujarat That (Food of Surat and Death of Kashi “સુરત નું જમણ અને કાશી નું મરણ“). It is a common belief that breathing your last in Kashi relieves you of all further rebirths and your soul is able to attain Moksha as Lord Vishwanath is the shelter for all who are ardent Shiva devotees. Kashi Vishwanath Temple, located in the sacred city of Varanasi. The Temple stands on the western bank of the holy river Ganga, and is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas the holiest of Shiva Temples.

<img class="image image--xl" src="/assets/images/posts/spiritual/lord-shiva-temples/13.jpg" alt="Kashi Vishwanath Temple"/>

**My Tip**:
Much divinity I am feeling right now, "wo kehtein hai na khusi k aasu nikal gaye is bhavya mandir ki history padhtein padhtein".

I haven't visited this divine temple yet but now I am all excited to visit once in my lifetime, a belief as describe in Shiv puran that in your last breath if you died reading shiv puran in kashi you will be free from rebirth cycle "someday I will so the same". As I get to know about Mahadev one of my pinpoint wish is to give myself to him after my death. I don't want to be in this birthing cycle but "bohot hi sidhe sade insaan ko aisa nasib hota hai but lets see😊"

Popular beliefs: A visit to the temple and a bath in the river **Ganges** is one of many methods believed to lead one on a path to _Moksha_ (liberation), Shiva's devotees on death being directly taken to his abode on Mount Kailash by his messengers and not to Yama.
The superiority of Shiva and his victory over his own nature--Shiva is himself identified with death--is also stated. There is a popular belief that Shiva himself blows the mantra of salvation into the ears of people who die naturally at the **Vishwanath** temple.

### How to reach

- **By road**: Varanasi has a wide and expansive road network, with frequent private and public buses and other road transport services to all major cities and towns in Uttar Pradesh.
- **By train**: Varanasi city is well connected by railway, and the temple itself is close to a number of railway stations. Varanasi City station is just 2 km away, and Varanasi Junction is around 6 km from the temple.
- **By flight**: The closest airport to the temple is the Lal Bahadur Shastri International Airport in Babatpur. From there, the temple is around 25 km or less than an hour by road.

#### Chant **Har Har Mahadev**.

## Ramanathaswamy (Rameshwaram)

Ramanathaswamy Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to the god Shiva located on Rameswaram island in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. It is also one of the twelve Jyotirlinga temples. The temple has the longest corridor among all Hindu temples in India. The presiding deity, the Lingam of Ramanathaswamy (Shiva), was established and worshiped by Rama before crossing his bridge to Lanka. According to the Ramayana, Rama, who is the seventh avatar of the god Vishnu, prayed to the god Shiva to absolve him of the sin of killing a Brahmin committed during the war against the Rakshasa king Ravana (who was a brahmin, son of a vedic rishi) in Sri Lanka. He directed Hanuman, to bring a lingam from the Himalayas. When Hanuman was delayed in bringing the lingam, devi Sita built a small lingam out of the sand available in the seashore, which is believed to be the lingam in the sanctum.

<img class="image image--xl" src="/assets/images/posts/spiritual/lord-shiva-temples/14.jpg" alt="Rameshwaram Temple"/>

The primary deity of the temple is Ramanathaswamy (Shiva) in the form of lingam. There are two lingams inside the sanctum - one built by Rama, from sand, residing as the main deity, Ramalingam and the one brought by Hanuman from Kailash called Vishwalingam. Rama instructed that the Vishwalingam should be worshipped first since it was brought by Hanuman - the tradition continues even today.

- **By road**: Rameswaram is well connected by roads to other cities of Tamil Nadu. Tamil Nadu Road Transport Corporation buses ply regularly from Chennai, Kanyakumari, Madurai, Trichy and other cities to Rameswaram. Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation buses also ply daily from Tirupati to Rameswaram.
- **By train**: The Rameswaram railway station is the major railhead. Trains from Chennai, Madurai, Coimbatore, Trichy, Thanjavur, Palakkad and Bengaluru halt at the station. Taxi services are available from the station.
- **By flight**: The nearest airport is at Madurai, about 174 km from Rameswaram. The airport is well connected by flights to many Indian cities like Chennai, Trichy, Bengaluru and Mumbai. Pre-paid taxi services are available from the airport.

**My Tip**:
Well there is something connecting magic between me and South India, yet I haven't visited this temple but I wanted to visit once to feel the serene divinity and that beautiful Indian railway bridge from my favourite place i.e. from the bogie door 😊, If you're a movie fan especially Srk's one and if have watched Chennai express then I bet you'll definitely visit Rameshwaram. If you're a biker or traveller as I am then you must opt for "Dhanush Kodi" which is nearby place to visit from Rameshwaram.

#### Chant **Har Har Mahadev**.
